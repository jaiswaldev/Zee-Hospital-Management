## üßê About The Project

The Zee Hospital Management System is a full-stack web application built to modernize hospital administration. Traditional paper-based systems are often inefficient and prone to errors. This project aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized and digital platform for managing all aspects of a hospital's operations.

Here's why this project is useful:
* **For Patients:** It simplifies the process of booking appointments and accessing their medical records.
* **For Doctors:** It allows for easy access to patient histories and management of their schedules.
* **For Administrators:** It provides a powerful dashboard for overseeing hospital resources, staff, and finances.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Patient Management:** Register new patients, manage patient records, and view medical history.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments with doctors.
* **Doctor Management:** Maintain a database of doctors, their specializations, and their schedules.
* **Billing and Invoicing:** Generate bills for medicines at store and manage patient payments.
* **Bed Management:** Track bed availability and assign beds to patients.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A comprehensive overview of the hospital's key metrics.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Patients) with different permissions.
